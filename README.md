## Basic Overview
The Basic Idea is that you are able to decide how much you want to be using every day on average, and the app will let you keep track of how much you've spent/saved daily and overall.

### Basic Functionality

The three screenshots above show the basic functionality of the app. You Record your spendings, on the left. You can see how much you have left today and how much you've saved so far in the middle and see all your previous spendings on the right. For the Display portion, "Remaining Today" will show the value of the daily limit subtracted by the amount you've spent today. At midnight, whatever is remaining from the day will get added to the "Total Savings."


### More Functionalities

The app includes a Splash screen as well as a one-time intro screen that gives you a brief explanation and also lets you set the daily limit before actually starting the app.

The Setting Menu lets you change the daily limit, the system UI, and manage subscriptions. You can add a "Save" button along with the Spend button if you want to add money to your savings. This is disabled by default as my idea of this app was simply recording my spendings regardless of how much money I have, so that I don't go easy on myself when I earn money. Changing to show the entire history will show all spendings in a infinitely growing list instead of showing it day by day.

The Subscription Management lets you register subscription payments for monthly or yearly payments. On the day of payment, a spending entry will be automatically created.

## Novelty of the Project

1. Helps to regulate your spending
2. Great for college/school students who find it hard to manage money.
